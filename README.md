        - [x] Keep the original spacing in the output as it is in the input.
        - [x] Highlight registers when used with other operators (`[eax]`, `[ebx+esi]`, etc).
        - [x] Highlight string literals (single and double quotes).
        - [ ] Add comments support (single/multi line).
        - [ ] Support HEX, BIN, and OCT notations.
